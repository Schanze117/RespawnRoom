## Nickname Implementation

The application uses Agora's Real-Time Messaging (RTM) SDK alongside RTC for implementing user nicknames. This approach ensures that user nicknames are properly displayed in real-time voice chats.

### Implementation Details

1. **RTM for User Metadata**: 
   - User nicknames are stored as attributes in the RTM system
   - The RTM client handles user presence and attribute management

2. **Login Sequence**:
   - RTM login occurs before RTC channel join
   - Nickname is set as an RTM user attribute
   - RTC join uses `joinChannelWithUserAccount` for proper identity linking

3. **Nickname Retrieval**:
   - When users join, their attributes are fetched via RTM
   - A retry mechanism handles race conditions in attribute propagation
   - Fallback to UID display if nickname retrieval fails

This implementation ensures that nicknames are consistent across the application and properly displayed for all participants in a room.
